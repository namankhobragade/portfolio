As organizations migrate to cloud-native architectures, traditional security models are no longer sufficient. Technologies like Docker and Kubernetes introduce new layers of abstraction and a more dynamic, ephemeral infrastructure that demands a shift in security thinking.

Cloud-native security is built on four key pillars: **Cloud, Containers, Code, and Cluster**.

1.  **Cloud Security**: Securing the underlying cloud infrastructure (IAM roles, network policies, VPCs).
2.  **Container Security**: Scanning container images for vulnerabilities before they are deployed.
3.  **Code Security**: Using SAST and DAST to find vulnerabilities in your application code.
4.  **Cluster Security**: Configuring Kubernetes securely (RBAC, Pod Security Policies, Network Policies).

A popular tool for container scanning is Trivy. It can be easily integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.

```bash
# Scan a container image for vulnerabilities
trivy image your-app:latest
```

By embedding security into every stage of the development lifecycle and adopting tools built for this new paradigm, you can secure your cloud-native applications effectively.
