Shifting security left is the core principle of DevSecOps. By integrating automated security checks early in the development lifecycle, you can catch vulnerabilities before they reach production. This article walks through the key stages of a secure CI/CD pipeline, from static analysis (SAST) in your git hooks to dynamic analysis (DAST) in your staging environment.

We'll cover practical examples of how to configure popular tools like SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, and Trivy for container scanning.

```yaml
# Example of a secure build stage in a CI/CD pipeline
jobs:
  sast-scan:
    image: sonarsource/sonar-scanner-cli
    script:
      - sonar-scanner \
        -Dsonar.projectKey=my-secure-app \
        -Dsonar.sources=. \
        -Dsonar.host.url=https://sonarqube.example.com
```

Adopting a DevSecOps culture not only improves security posture but also accelerates development by reducing the friction between development and security teams.
