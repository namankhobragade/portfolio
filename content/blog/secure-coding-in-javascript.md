JavaScript's ubiquity makes it a prime target for attackers. This guide provides developers with actionable advice and best practices for writing secure JavaScript code. We'll cover common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and insecure direct object references.

Each section includes code examples of both vulnerable and secured implementations, focusing on modern frameworks like React and Next.js. Learn how to leverage built-in security features, sanitize inputs, and use security headers to build more resilient web applications.

Here is an example of sanitizing input in a React component to prevent XSS:

```jsx
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

function UserComment({ comment }) {
  // Unsafe: Directly rendering user input can lead to XSS
  // return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: comment.text }} />;

  // Safe: Sanitize the HTML before rendering
  const sanitizedHtml = DOMPurify.sanitize(comment.text);
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: sanitizedHtml }} />;
}
```

By adopting these practices, you can significantly reduce the attack surface of your applications and protect your users' data.
