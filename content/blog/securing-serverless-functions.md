Serverless computing abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, but it doesn't eliminate security concerns. Instead, it shifts the focus from securing servers to securing functions, data, and configurations. Here are some key best practices for serverless security.

**1. Apply the Principle of Least Privilege:**
Each function should have an IAM role with the absolute minimum permissions required to perform its task. If a function only needs to read from a DynamoDB table, its role should not include write or delete permissions.

```json
// Example IAM Policy for a Lambda function
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "dynamodb:GetItem",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/MyTable"
        }
    ]
}
```

**2. Secure Your Dependencies:**
A function is only as secure as its weakest dependency. Use tools like `npm audit` or Snyk to regularly scan your project for vulnerable packages and update them promptly.

**3. Manage Secrets Securely:**
Never hardcode API keys, database credentials, or other secrets directly in your function's code. Use a dedicated secrets management service like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault. These services provide secure storage and automatic rotation of secrets.

By adopting these practices, you can build serverless applications that are not only scalable and cost-effective but also secure.
