APIs are the backbone of modern applications, but they are also a primary target for attackers. While rate limiting and API keys are a good start, robust security requires a multi-layered approach.

This article explores advanced strategies to secure your APIs, focusing on authentication and authorization. We'll look at how OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) provide a standardized, secure way to handle access for both users and services.

```json
// Example of a JWT payload with custom claims for authorization
{
  "iss": "https://auth.devsec.app/",
  "sub": "user-123",
  "aud": "https://api.devsec.app/",
  "iat": 1672531199,
  "exp": 1672534799,
  "scope": "read:projects write:tasks",
  "permissions": ["delete:own_tasks"]
}
```

Beyond authentication, fine-grained access control (using scopes and custom claims in JWTs) ensures that even authenticated users can only access the specific resources they are permitted to. By implementing these patterns, you can build a resilient API that is secure against a wide range of threats.
