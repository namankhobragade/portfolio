The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security professionals. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. Here's a quick look at a few key items and how to mitigate them.

### A01: Broken Access Control
This occurs when restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are not properly enforced.

**Prevention**:
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) checks on the server-side for every request.
- Deny by default. Users should not have access to anything unless explicitly granted.

```javascript
// Example of an access control check in an Express.js middleware
function canDeletePost(req, res, next) {
  const post = await Post.findById(req.params.id);
  if (req.user.role !== 'admin' && post.authorId !== req.user.id) {
    return res.status(403).send('Forbidden');
  }
  next();
}
```

### A02: Cryptographic Failures
This category focuses on failures related to cryptography, which often lead to the exposure of sensitive data.

**Prevention**:
- Always use TLS for data in transit.
- Use strong, modern, and standard hashing algorithms like Argon2 or bcrypt for storing passwords.
- Don't reinvent the wheel. Use well-vetted cryptographic libraries.

### A03: Injection
Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, and OS injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.

**Prevention**:
- Use a safe, parameterized query interface (like prepared statements) to interact with your database.
- Sanitize and validate all user input on the server side.

By understanding these common risks, you can build more secure and resilient applications from the ground up.
