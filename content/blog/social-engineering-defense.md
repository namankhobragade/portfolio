Social engineering is the art of manipulating people into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. Unlike attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, social engineering targets the weakest link in any security chain: human nature.

The most common form is **phishing**, where attackers send fraudulent emails that appear to be from a reputable source to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.

Key defense strategies include:
1.  **Awareness Training**: Regularly train employees to recognize the signs of a phishing attempt, such as a sense of urgency, suspicious links, or unexpected attachments.
2.  **Verify Requests**: Foster a culture where it's acceptable and encouraged to question and independently verify unusual requests, especially those involving financial transactions or credential changes.
3.  **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: MFA provides a critical layer of defense. Even if an attacker steals a password, they won't be able to access the account without the second factor.
4.  **Simulated Phishing Campaigns**: Conduct controlled, simulated phishing attacks to test employee awareness and reinforce training in a safe environment.

Ultimately, building a "human firewall" through continuous education and a security-conscious culture is the most effective way to thwart these attacks.
