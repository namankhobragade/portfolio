## ðŸ”§ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation & Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/naman-mahi/devsec.git
    cd devsec
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your Google AI API key for the proposal generator to work.
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key
    ```
    You can get a free key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

4.  **Run the development server:**
    The application runs on two parallel processes: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI server.

    - **In your first terminal, run the Next.js app:**
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```
      This will start the website on [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

    - **In your second terminal, run the Genkit AI server:**
      ```bash
      npm run genkit:dev
      ```
      This starts the local Genkit development server, which the Next.js app will call for AI features.

## ðŸŽ¨ Customization

This portfolio is designed to be easily personalized. For detailed instructions, please see the **[CUSTOMIZATION.md](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md)** file.

Here's a quick overview of what you can change:

- **Personal Information**: Edit `src/lib/data.ts` to update your skills, projects, experience, education, and certifications.
- **Images**: Replace the images in the `public/images` folder. See the customization guide for exact file names.
- **Blog Posts**: Add, edit, or delete Markdown files in the `content/blog` directory.
- **Theme**: Modify the color scheme and fonts in `src/app/globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`.
- **AI Prompt**: Fine-tune the AI proposal generator's prompt in `src/ai/flows/ai-service-proposal-tool.ts`.

## ðŸš€ Deployment

This project is configured for seamless deployment on platforms that support Next.js's full feature set, including server-side rendering and API routes.

**Important**: Do not deploy this project to a static hosting provider like GitHub Pages, as it will break the AI features and contact form.

### Recommended Platforms

- **Vercel**: The easiest and most recommended way to deploy a Next.js application. Simply connect your Git repository, and Vercel handles the rest.
- **Firebase App Hosting**: A great choice within the Google ecosystem, fully compatible with modern web frameworks like Next.js.

### Deployment Steps (Vercel Example)

1.  Push your code to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.
2.  Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new) and create a new project.
3.  Import your Git repository.
4.  Add your `GEMINI_API_KEY` as an environment variable in the project settings.
5.  Click "Deploy". Vercel will automatically build and deploy your site.
